<b>What is Blockchine? </b><br>
Bitcoin is the world's first completely decentralized digital currency, also known as a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin introduced a technology called a blockchain, which is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger of timestamped transactions.

Before the invention of Bitcoin, ledgers had to be maintained by central authorities like banks, which kept a single authoritative copy of the ledger. This meant that users that relied on a ledger had to trust the central authority.

Bitcoin's use of a blockchain eliminates the need for central authorities and the need to trust them. It does this by allowing each user of the system to maintain their own copy of the ledger and keeping all copies of the ledger verifiably synchronized through a consensus algorithm.

Bitcoin is designed to allow its users to hold, send, and receive money online, but distributed ledgers can be used to do much more, including clearing and settlement of digital asset trading, provisining of identity, and distributed computing—all without the need for central intermediaries. The 10-minute video that follows presents plain English explanation of these concepts and why they have the potential to change the world.
A blockchain, originally block chain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. 
Blockchains which are readable by the public are widely used by cryptocurrencies.<br>
A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and incorruptible digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers.<br>
